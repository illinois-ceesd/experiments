# experiments
Simulation drivers archive

This repository houses drivers, configurations, and
experiments that use CEESD codes, including mirgecom.

This repo has the potential to become a large
parking lot for useless things falling into
disrepair.  How do we stop it?

 * Periodic CI?
 * Nightly tests (under what conditions?)
 * Manifest?  a top-level file of repo contents
